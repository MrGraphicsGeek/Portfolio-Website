              <p>Infinity Spacelines was a passion project I did in my spare time to sharpen both my coding and design skills. It's a 
                fantasy website based around travel and tourism. Since this was a fictitious project, I decided to have fun with it 
                and base it around space, something I've always been interested in.</p>

          <h1 class="h1">The Process</h1>
        <div class="ISbody">

            <div class="RoughSketching">
              <h2>Rough Sketching</h2>
              <div class="ISbodyimgR">
                  <img class="imagedesktop" src="images/case study images/Sketches.jpg" alt="Sketches of various components">
                  <img class="imagemobile" src="images/case study images/Sketchesmobile.jpg" alt="Sketches of various components">
              </div>
              <p> I started out the process with various rough sketches of site pages and other design ideas. Since I decided Infinity Spacelines is set in a period
              where space travel is as common as air travel, I looked to those respective sites for inspiration when it came to the general layout. For further ideas,
              I visited other miscellaneous websites on the internet to see what other features I could implement.</p>
              <p>I did photoshop drawings after sketching on paper, where I refined the look of the pages even further. I decided the site would have 5 main 
              pages in addition to the home page. Still, I didn't concern myself with every little detail at this point, knowing I could come up with more ideas as I went.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="Coding">
              <h2>Coding</h2>
              <div class="ISbodyimgL">
                <img class="imagedesktop" src="images/case study images/roughsite.png" alt="Early screenshot of home page">
                <img class="imagemobile" src="images/case study images/roughsitemobile.png" alt="Early screenshot of home page">
              </div>
                <p>Once I had a decent idea of how the site should look, it was time to start coding. Since I hadn't made any real images or icons yet, I knew the site was going to look 
                like a bare skeleton. This would give me the chance to test and refine things like image dimensions without being committed to anything.</p>
                <p>One of the elements I'm most happy with is the main header and navigation. A fixed header is something I've been meaning to add to one of my 
                websites for a while, but never understood how. After much research on methods that involved JS, I was finally able to pull it off using pure CSS, giving me exactly 
                what I wanted.</p>
                <p>With the framework of Infinity Spacelines now in place, I was free to start work on the artistic side of the project.</p>  
            </div>

            <div class="BrandDesign">
                <h2>Creating a logo</h2>
                <div class="ISbodyimgR">
                  <img class="ISbodyimgR2" src="images/case study images/Logo prototype.png" alt="The rejected logo">
                  <img src="images/case study images/Infinity Spacelines logo.svg" alt="Infinity Spacelines logo" width="400px">
                </div>
                <p>Creating a site for a fictional business meant I'd also be designing the company's logo. As I soon as I came up with	
                the name "Infinity Spacelines", I immediately began sketching ideas. An early logo I had in mind featured the initialism "IS",
                but I soon realized that this looked too much like the word "is".</p>
                <p>I'd say the most challenging aspect of this was finding the right font. I knew using something generic like Arial black would be too boring, 
                but a more complex font would look too busy and wouldn't fit the sleek, futuristic look I was going for. Eventually I found the perfect balance 
                in a font called Quicksilver Italic.</p>
                <p>The final result is a logo I'm very proud of. I think it perfectly captures the space-age aesthetic I was after.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="ImageDesign">
                <h2>Image Design</h2>
                <div class="ISbodyimgL">
                  <img class="imagedesktop" src="images/case study images/Image comparison.png" alt="Side-by-side of original plane image with final spaceship image">
                  <img class="imagemobile" src="images/case study images/Image comparison mobile.png" alt="Side-by-side of original plane image with final spaceship image">
                </div>
                <p>The sites images' were done by me in Photoshop and Illustrator, mainly utilizing stock images I found on free image websites. This is where
                I let my imagination run wild, dreaming up things like flying buses to alien temples to food floating in zero gravity.</p>
                <p>Since I knew I'd have a hard time finding images of things like spaceships, I had to either create them from scratch, or trace them from
                  an existing image. For the header image seen on the home page, tracing an image of a private jet made for a sufficent starship.</p>
                <p>In all, I made about 35 custom images for this project. It was  a lot of fun implementing all these different elements into a functioning website.</p>

              <p>I think that the Infinity Spacelines project was a great success and makes a fine addition to my portfolio. This is the most elaborate website I've done so far. 
              I've now gained more confidence in my abilities, and I'm looking forward to applying the skills I learned here to my future projects.</p>
